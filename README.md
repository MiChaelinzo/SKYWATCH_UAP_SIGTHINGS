## Neon Nights - Cyberpunk Side-Scroller 🌆

### Inspiration 🌠

We've always been captivated by the cyberpunk genre - the gritty atmosphere, the societal tensions, and the potential for incredible stories. When we saw the stunning 2D Neon Environments asset, we knew we had to build a world around it. We were also inspired by classic side-scrolling action games, and we wanted to bring that fast-paced gameplay into a cyberpunk setting. 

### What it does 🛰️

Neon Nights is a side-scrolling action game set in a sprawling cyberpunk metropolis.  Players take on the role of a skilled runner, navigating a world on the brink of chaos.  The game combines:

* **Fluid Action Combat:**  Engage in fast-paced combat encounters using a variety of melee and ranged weapons, along with cybernetic augmentations. 
* **Immersive Cyberpunk World:** Explore detailed 2D environments brought to life with vibrant pixel art, atmospheric lighting, and a captivating soundtrack.
* **Branching Narrative:** Make choices that shape the story and influence the fate of the city's inhabitants.

### How we built it 🏗️

* **Unity Engine:** We used Unity as our game development engine, leveraging its 2D tools and workflows.
* **Neon 2D Locations Asset:**  This asset pack provided the foundation for our game's visuals, giving us a head start on building our world. 
* **C# Programming:**  We used C# for gameplay programming, character control, enemy AI, and interactive elements.
* **Pixel Art and Animation:**  We created custom pixel art and animations to bring our characters and world to life.

### Challenges we ran into 🚧

* **Scope Management:** Cyberpunk worlds are rich in detail, and it was challenging to balance our ambitions with the time constraints of the hackathon. 
* **Gameplay Balance:**  Balancing combat encounters, character progression, and enemy difficulty to create a rewarding player experience required careful iteration.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏆

* **Stunning Visuals:**  We're incredibly proud of the visual atmosphere we achieved, combining the beautiful 2D assets with our custom artwork and lighting.

### What we learned 🎓
